# Node-level Associations Between Cell Types And Connectivity


The goal of this research project is to explore the internal relationships of __brain cell types__ and __connectivity__.

Overview: We consider this as a graph problem: Among the brain, there are many different Region of Interests (ROIs). In our research, we split the brain into 86 ROIs following the Desikan-Killiany Atlas.

The recommended steps of working on this project.


1. Read the paper preprint.

2. Download this GitHub repo -- this provides you the datasets as well as some skelenton notebooks. A thorough guide of using GitHub can be found here.

3. Run the Begginer's Guide Jupyter Notebook. Make sure that you have installed the necessary libraries. Use `pip install XYZ` if missing any dependency.

4. Understand the dataset.
