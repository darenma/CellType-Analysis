# Node-level Associations Between Cell Types And Connectivity


The goal of this research project is to explore the internal relationships of __brain cell types__ and __connectivity__.

Overview: We consider this as a graph problem: Among the brain, there are many different Region of Interests (ROIs). In our research, we split the brain into 86 ROIs following the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. In this way, the brain connectivity network is translated into a graph with 86 nodes connected by many edges. For each node, there are ~30 node features representing the significance of each 




The recommended steps of working on this project.


1. Read the paper preprint.

2. Download this GitHub repo -- this provides you the datasets as well as some skelenton notebooks. A thorough guide of using GitHub can be found here. 
 - To simplify the collaboration process, please create a branch of your name once you have started coding. Keep track of your progress every time. 
 - Daren will go through the codes and merge the branches into main branch every Friday.

3. Run the Begginer's Guide Jupyter Notebook. Make sure that you have installed the necessary libraries. Use `pip install XYZ` if missing any dependency.

4. Understand the dataset. Play with it a bit to figure out.







Weekly Meeting: 9:30 PST (11:30 CT) every Wednesday.
